## About This Tutorial

In this tutorial series, you will build an ABP based web application named `Acme.BookStore`. This application is used to manage a list of books and their authors. It is developed using the following technologies:

* **{{DB_Text}}** as the ORM provider.

- [Part 1: Creating the server side](Part-1.md)
- [Part 2: The book list page](Part-2.md)

- [Part 4: Integration tests](Part-4.md)
- [Part 5: Authorization](Part-5.md)
- [Part 6: Authors: Domain layer](Part-6.md)
